        Nikola Tesla inventions constitute numerous technological breakthroughs
        throughout his lifetime. Born in Smiljan, Croatia, in 1856, the math and
        physics genius contributed innovations that continue to impact our lives
        daily today. He held over three hundred patents, but was only recognized
        for some, indicating many of his ideas were tested and failed or never
        became well known. <br /><br />
        In 1882, upon graduation from the Technical University of Graz and
        Philosophy at the University of Prague, he drew the first sketches of
        his idea to build an electromagnetic motor. His first job entailed
        retailing DC power plants for ConEd which led to his immigration to the
        states in 1884.

      <h3>Nikola Tesla’s Best-Known Invention — the Alternating Current</h3>
      <p>
        When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in
        Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct
        current method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not
        as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting
        electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay
        Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his
        next endeavor. <br /><br />He applied for many patents for his AC power
        discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been
        widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio
        and television transmission.

      <h3>The Tesla Coil</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most familiar symbol of Tesla’s work is the Tesla coil,
        embodied in the tower that was erected at what is now the last remaining
        laboratory located in Shoreham, New York, the Tesla Science Center at
        Wardenclyffe. Here, Tesla created a tower topped by his infamous coils
        which shot electric sparks through the air and circulated the
        electricity around the coils by alternating current.
      </p>

      <h3>Magnifying Transmitter</h3>
      Building upon the revelations of the Tesla coil, Tesla sought to offer
      wireless power for free to all by transmitting information from one tower
      to another using resonance. The currents were sent from one circuit to the
      other, building in frequency until lightning sparked from one tower to the
      other. By connecting a wire to the tower and running it around his lab, he
      powered his laboratory wirelessly. He demonstrated the effect on stage to
      audiences using light bulbs that were not connected to any power source.
      The magnifying transmitter succeeded in transmitting an electrical current
      a kilometer away.
