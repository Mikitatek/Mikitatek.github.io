          Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
          the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
          HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
          is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
          content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
          load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
          the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
          methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
          browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS
          also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
          a mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
          determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
          particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
          with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
          validation service for CSS documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
          including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
        <header>Syntax</header>
        <p>
          CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to
          specify the names of various style properties.<br />
          A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set
          consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
        <header>Selector</header>
        <p>
          In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to
          by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.<br /><br />

          Selectors may apply to the following:<br /><br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
          <li>
            elements specified by attribute, in particular:
            <ul>
              <li>
                id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the
                selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
              </li>
              <li>
                class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a
                document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase
                "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element
                classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup
                feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the
                related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF
                and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the
                Web content model)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the
            document tree.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can
          include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may
          apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be
          applied to a single element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on
          information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of
          a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which identifies
          content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by
          holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in
          <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class
          classifies document elements, such as <code>:link</code> or
          <code>:visited</code>, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that
          may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or
          <code>::first-letter</code>. Note the double-colon notation for
          pseudo-elements versus single-colon notation for pseudo-class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity
          and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to
          specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any
          combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For
          example, <code>div .myClass {color: red;}</code> applies to all
          elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas
          <code>.myClass div {color: red;}</code> applies to all div elements
          that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused
          with concatenated identifiers such as
          <code>div.myClass {color: red;}</code> which applies to div elements
          of class myClass.
        </p>

          The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating
          usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.

          A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each
          declaration itself consists of a property, a colon <code>(:)</code>,
          and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a
          semi-colon <code>(;)</code> must be inserted to separate each
          declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single)
          declaration may be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set
          of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element,
          and others apply only to particular groups of elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical
          values, such as <code>200px</code> (200 pixels), <code>50vw</code> (50
          percent of the viewport width) or <code>80%</code> (80 percent of the
          parent element's width). Color values can be specified with keywords
          (e.g. "<code>red</code>"), hexadecimal values (e.g.
          <code>#FF0000</code>, also abbreviated as <code>#F00</code>), RGB
          values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. <code>rgb(255, 0, 0)</code>), RGBA
          values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g.
          <code>rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)</code>), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g.
          <code>hsl(000, 100%, 50%)</code>,
          <code>hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)</code>).

        <p>
          Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a
          length unit, which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in
          <code>200px</code> or <code>50vw</code>; or a percentage sign, as in
          <code>80%</code>. Some units - <code>cm</code> (centimetre);
          <code>in</code> (inch); <code>mm</code> (millimetre);
          <code>pc</code> (pica); and <code>pt</code> (point) - are absolute,
          which means that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the
          structure of the page; others - <code>em</code> (em);
          <code>ex</code> (ex) and <code>px</code> (pixel)[clarification needed]
          - are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a
          parent element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units
          were a feature of CSS 1 and retained in all subsequent revisions. The
          proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a W3C
          Recommendation, provide seven further length units: <code>ch</code>;
          <code>Q</code>; <code>rem</code>; <code>vh</code>; <code>vmax</code>;
          <code>vmin</code>; and <code>vw</code>.

        <p>
          Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents
          were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background
          styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
          described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move
          much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting
          in considerably simpler HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2),
          sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In
          print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for
          these elements is presentational.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic
          characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML
          presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This
          made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and
          difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from
          structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders,
          spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do
          so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines
          non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text
          readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML
          markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red
          text would be written as:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;h1&#x3E;&#x3C;font color=&#x22;red&#x22;&#x3E;Chapter 1.&#x3C;/font&#x3E;&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties
          instead of HTML presentational attributes:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;h1 style=&#x22;color: red&#x22;&#x3E;Chapter 1.&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of
          CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an
          internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For
          example, suppose the document contains the style element:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;style&#x3E;
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
&#x3C;/style&#x3E;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red
          without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to
          make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the
          style element to:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;style&#x3E;
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
&#x3C;/style&#x3E;

</code></pre>
        <p>
          rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the
          color for each individual h1 element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described
          below, and loaded using syntax similar to:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;link href=&#x22;path/to/file.css&#x22; rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; type=&#x22;text/css&#x22;/&#x3E;
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it
          possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing a shared
          external CSS file.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Sources">
        <header>Sources</header>
        <p>
          CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources
          can be the web browser, the user, and the author. The information from
          the author can be further classified into inline, media type,
          importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance, and
          property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate
          document, or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style
          sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on
          the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be
          quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor
          the presentation appropriately for each medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content
          display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are
          passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style.
          The process is called cascading.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over
          presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read
          may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the
          web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the
          designers, or may remove all added styles and view the site using the
          browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic heading
          style without altering other attributes.

      <section class="main-section" id="Specificity">
        <header>Specificity</header>
        <p>
          Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules. It
          determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule
          could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a
          specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID
          selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do
          not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate
          the "digits" (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have
          a specificity of 11,11, not 121).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the following rules selectors result in the indicated
          specificity:

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        Consider this HTML fragment:
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;head&#x3E;
        &#x3C;meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;&#x3E;
        &#x3C;style&#x3E;
            #xyz { color: blue; }
        &#x3C;/style&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;body&#x3E;
        &#x3C;p id=&#x22;xyz&#x22; style=&#x22;color: green;&#x22;&#x3E;To demonstrate specificity&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;
          </code></pre>
        In the above example, the declaration in the
        <code>style</code> attribute overrides the one in the
        <code>&#x3C;style&#x3E;</code> element because it has a higher
        specificity, and thus, the paragraph appears green:
        <div class="demo-box">
          <span id="green-text-demo">To demonstrate specificity</span>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
        <header>Inheritance</header>
        <p>
          Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the
          ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the
          mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified
          element, but also to its descendants.[16] Inheritance relies on the
          document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page
          based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values
          from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant
          elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related
          properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are
          color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align,
          text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing.
          Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display,
          float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and
          -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration,
          vertical-align and z-index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and
          over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based
          programming languages, where it is possible to define class B as "like
          class A, but with modifications". With CSS, it is possible to style an
          element with "class A, but with modifications". However, it is not
          possible to define a CSS class B like that, which could then be used
          to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        Given the following style sheet:
        <pre><code>
p {
  color: pink;
}
        </code></pre>
        Suppose there is a p element with an emphasizing element
        (&#x3C;em&#x3E;) inside:
        <pre><code>
&#x3C;p&#x3E;
  This is to &#x3C;em&#x3E;illustrate&#x3C;/em&#x3E;inheritance
&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
        </code></pre>
        If no color is assigned to the em element, the emphasized word
        "illustrate" inherits the color of the parent element, p. The style
        sheet p has the color pink, hence, the em element is likewise pink:
        <div class="demo-box">
          <span id="pink-text-demo">This is to illustrate inheritance</span>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Whitespace">
        <header>Whitespace</header>
        Whitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code
        snippet:
        <pre><code>
body{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}
          </code></pre>
        is functionally equivalent to this one:
        <pre><code>
body {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #000000;
  background-image: url(images/bg.gif);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: left top;
}
          </code></pre>
        One common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property
        and give it its own line. In addition to formatting CSS for readability,
        shorthand properties can be used to write out the code faster, which
        also gets processed more quickly when being rendered:
        <pre><code>
body {
  overflow: hidden;
  background: #000 url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;
}
        </code></pre>
        Sometimes, multiple property values are indented onto their own line:
        <pre><code>
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Comic Sans'
  font-size: 20px
  src: url('first.example.com'),
  url('second.example.com'),
  url('third.example.com'),
  url('fourth.example.com'),
}
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Positioning">
        <header>Positioning</header>
        <h4>Normal flow</h4>
        <p>
          Inline items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in
          text, one after the other across the available space until there is no
          more room, then starting a new line below. Block items stack
          vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list.
          Normal flow also includes relative positioning of block or inline
          items, and run-in boxes.
        </p>
        <h4>Floats</h4>
        <p>
          A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left
          or right as far as possible in the space available. Other content then
          flows alongside the floated item.
        </p>
        <h4>Absolute positioning</h4>
        <p>
          An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the
          normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its
          container independently of other items.
        </p>
        <h4>Position property</h4>
        <p>
          There are five possible values of the <code>position</code> property.
          If an item is positioned in any way other than <code>static</code>,
          then the further properties <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
          <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> are used to specify offsets
          and positions.The element having position static is not affected by
          the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code> , <code>left</code> or
          <code>right</code> properties.
        </p>
        <h4>Static</h4>
        <p>The default value places the item in the normal flow</p>
        <h4>Relative</h4>
        <p>
          The item is placed in the normal flow, and then shifted or offset from
          that position. Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had
          not been moved.
        </p>
        <h4>Absolute</h4>
        <p>
          Specifies absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation
          to its nearest non-static ancestor.
        </p>
        <h4>Fixed</h4>
        <p>
          The item is absolutely positioned in a fixed position on the screen
          even as the rest of the document is scrolled
        </p>
        <h4>Float and clear</h4>
        <p>
          The <code>float</code> property may have one of three values.
          Absolutely positioned or fixed items cannot be floated. Other elements
          normally flow around floated items, unless they are prevented from
          doing so by their <code>clear</code> property.
        </p>
        <h4>left</h4>
        <p>
          The item floats to the left of the line that it would have appeared
          in; other items may flow around its right side.
        </p>
        <h4>right</h4>
